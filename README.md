### My Leetcode solutions ONLY in Go

First of all I am not good at algorithms, and I don't have degree in CS. 
Yet I would like to share my solutions on leetcode challenges.
Programmers with good knowledge of algorithms are welcome to contribute by providing better
solutions with good description!
Programmers with a little experience, self-taught programmers like me or people with no experience
in Go and algorithms are welcome to learn and share this project!

### Structure
Every folder has a file with code and description of how I have ended up with that solution.
